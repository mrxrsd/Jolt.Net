    /**
     * Traversr allows you to walk JSON tree structures of data, and to GET and SET operations.
     *
     * Corner cases that arise during tree walk, are handled by subclasses.
     * Ex: If no data exists mid tree walk quit or insert a new container?
     *     Or if there is data but it is the wrong type : overwrite or skip?
     *
     * Traversr analyzes the path path to be traversed and creates a "linked list" of Traversal objects.
     *
     * Then that list of Traversals can be used many times to write data into different JSON tree structures
     *  with different key values.
     *
     * For example given a Shiftr output path of :  "tuna[&1].bob.&3[]" some of the keys are known,
     *  "tuna" and "bob", but other keys will only be known later.
     *
     * However, the structure of the output path will not change, which means we can do some work before
     *  the keys are known.
     *
     * First the output path is turned into its canonical form : "tuna.[4].[&1].bob.&3.[]".
     * Then, a series of Traversals is created.
     *  tuna -> MapTraversal
     *  [&1] -> ArrayTraversal
     *  bob  -> MapTraversal
     *  &3   -> MapTraversal
     *  []   -> AutoExpandArrayTraversal
     *
     * Later, a list of keys can then be provided, such as
     *  [ "tuna", "2", "bob", "smith", "[]" ], and they can be quickly used without having to build or
     *  parse any more objects.
     *
     * The list of keys are all Strings, which ArrayTraversals will convert to Integers as needed.
