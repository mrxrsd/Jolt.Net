     * Utility class for use in custom Transforms.

     * Allows a programmer to just provide a single "human readable path"
     *  that they will want to be able to execute against multiple trees of data.
     *
     * Internally, parses the "human readable path" into a Traversr and a set of keys,
     *  so that the user only needs to call get/set with their input tree.
     *
     * Because the path is static, it is assumed that you will always be reading and writing
     *  objects of the same type to the tree, therefore this class can take a generic
     *  parameter "K" to reduce casting.
